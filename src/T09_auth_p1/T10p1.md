# Authentication / Authorization

---

# Authentication - `authen`

- A process of verifying user identity.
- Who is the user?
- Is the user really who he/she represents himself to be?

---

# Authorization - `author`

- A process of verifying a userâ€™s access level.
- Is user `X` authorized to access resource `R`?
- Is user `X` authorized to perform operation `P`?

---

# Note

`authen` and `author` do not exist separately.

- Users try to access protected APIs:
  - Applications might need to allow user based on role (`author`) but also need to know user identities (`authen`).
- Social login (i.e. Google):
  - Users verify themselves to Google (`authen`) but authorize applications (`author`) to access their resources.

---

# Approach

Rather than talking about `authen` vs `author`, let's focus on requirements:

- How do users sign up/in with credentials?
- How do users sign up/in with social accounts?
- How do we persist users' auth states?
  - So that users don't need to sign in at every request.

---

# Part 1: Signing up/in with credential

---

# Situation

- User fill in username and password.
- Your app creates user entry in database.
- _How do you store password?_
  - (and also compare it?)

# 6 levels of safety

# Note (1)

- [SHA256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html)
- [Rawinbow table attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack#Pre-computed_dictionary_attack/Rainbow_table_attack)
- `bcrypt` hash
  ![width:900](./img/bcrypt_hash.png)

---

# Note (2)

- It should be noted that the resulting "hash" contain `salt`.
  - The inclusion of `salt` is so that we do not need to keep track of it.
- But this also leave room for hacker to use it to regenerate rainbow table on the fly.
  - This is why we need cost factor.

---

# `bcrypt` example

- `git clone -b bcrypt https://github.com/fullstack-67/auth-mpa-v2.git auth-bcrypt`
- `pnpm i`
- `npx tsx ./src/hash.ts`
- `npx tsx ./src/compare.ts`

---

# Note on the code

- Promisify the callback style.
- Increasing time to generate (and compare) hash with incrasing `saltRounds`.
- The use of `bcrypt.compare`
- Use of `debug` package.

# Section 1B: Implementation with `passport`

---

# `passport`

- Most popular authentication middleware for `express`.
- Minimal and modular
- [500+ strategies](https://www.passportjs.org/) (click at button)
- Confusing and [poor documented](https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/vbuv2s/passportjs_alternatives_in_2022/?rdt=52617) ðŸ¤£
  - [Hidden manual](https://github.com/jwalton/passport-api-docs)

---

# Let's see it

- `git clone -b signin-credential https://github.com/fullstack-67/auth-mpa-v2.git auth-signin-credential`
- `pnpm i`
- `npm run db:reset`
- `npm run dev`

---

# Side note about the project

- MPA - HTMX
- Use `SQLite` + `drizzle`.
  - Checkout the schema.
- Try debugging in VSCode.
  - See `launch.json`.

---

# Highlighed packages

`package.json`

```json
{
  "passport": "^0.7.0",
  "passport-local": "^1.0.0"
}
```

---

# Middleware

`src/index.ts`

```ts
passport.use(
  new LocalStrategy(
    {
      // Options
    },
    async function (email, password, done) {
      // Verify email / password
    }
  )
);
//
app.use(passport.initialize());
```

[Available options](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-local?tab=readme-ov-file#available-options)

---

# Route

```ts
app.post(
  "/login",
  passport.authenticate("local", { session: false }),
  function (req, res) {
    // * Passport will attach user object in the request
  }
);
```
